<h4 id="part1">1 - What is computer science ?</h4>

<p>In our lives, we are faced with problems (like how to buy groceries or how to build a table). To solve them, we need to transform these problems in a list of smaller problems (to buy groceries we need to go to the store, grab what is needed, go to the checkout, give money and go home) and repeat this process for each of those problems until they are as basic as possible. Machines are able to do just the same: they are able to take a complex information (the problem) and break it down into usable information.</p>

<p>We can solve simple problems on our own, but there are times when the problem is too big or too complex for a human to resolve: that's when we need computer sciences.</p>

<p>Computer science is the science that deals with the theory and methods of processing information in digital computers, meaning it is the art of using computers to resolve complex or repetitives tasks. Programmers use this science to solve problems by teaching computers how to resolve problems with algorithms.</p>

<h4 id="part2">2 - What are algorithms ?</h4>
<p>An algorithm is a set of unambiguous rules to be followed to solve a problem or to calculate something. It is a list of operation to execute in a specific order.</p>

<p>Let's take an example: what do we do when we add two numbers? We take one of the two number, and then we add 1 to it while we remove 1 from the other, and we stop when the 2nd number is 0. We can clearly see here the rules , the steps to follow and the order.</p>

<p>Algorithm, in the scientific sense, are written using a certain syntax to avoid ambiguity and they come in two kinds:</p>

<p>The algorithm (paper version) is written by an <strong>analyst</strong> and executed by a <strong>contractor</strong>. The user gives the values and receives the results.</p>

<p>The program (machine version) is coded by a <strong>programmer</strong> and executed by a <strong>computer</strong>. The user types on the keyboard and the screen reads.</p>

<p>There are plenty more examples of algorithm in real life : recipe, installation instructions...</p>

<p>An algorithm has 4 parts:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A <strong>Header</strong> who contains the name of our algorithm</li>
  <li>Some <strong>Statements</strong> who are steps of preparation for executing the algorithm (more on that later...)</li>
  <li>Some <strong>Actions</strong> who are the steps to execute</li>
  <li>And <strong>Comments</strong> whose job is to explain to the reader what a particuliar step in the algorithm is doing or why (they have no impact on the algorithm). </li>
</ul> 

<p>Here is an example of the algorithm syntax :</p>
<pre>
<code><u>Algorithm</u> A_title <-- the header

<u>variables</u> <-- list of all statements
  name_var1 : type <-- a statement

<u>Beginning</u> <-- list of all actions in order
  instructions <-- an action
  //one comment
  ...
<u>End</u></code>
</pre>

<!--<p>The two bases of the algorithms :</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The <strong>variables</strong>, in which it stores the information (temporary storage area).</li>
  <li>The <strong>instructions</strong> for changing the status of these variables.</li>
</ul>--> 

<p>The algorithmic language is not standardized (â‰  programming languages) but must have a syntax swhich must be respected and unambiguous. On the other hand, there are many "programming languages" that exists : each of them is a slightly different way for you to explain an algorithm to your computer so in essence, they are just different ways to translate algorithms into a language that your computer can understand. </p>

<p>In this course we will use both algorithm to understand the theory and a language called javascript so that you may experiment on your own.</p>


<h4 id="part3">3 - Software requirements and installation</h4>

<p> In this lesson, you will not have to dowload any other software.</p>

<p>We invite you to check the link "Write code" (on the top of the web site) for practice on your own. This link will send you to a webpage where you will be able to write javascript. </p>
<p>On the left side there will be a frame with "JavaScript" written on top of it : this is where you may write your code.</p>
<p>In the middle, there is a frame named Console : this is where you will see the results of your programs.</p>
<p>Finally on the right side there is a frame named Output : this frame will come into play later.</p>
